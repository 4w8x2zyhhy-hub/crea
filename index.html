          <p>
            This page provides general best practices for dental hygiene professionals and practice teams when a patient raises concerns
            after a routine procedure. The goal is patient safety, clear communication, and appropriate clinical escalation.
          </p>

          <h2>Core Best Practices</h2>

          <p><b>1) Pause and assess immediately</b><br>
            When a patient reports an unexpected sensation or observes a change following a procedure, best practice is to pause and
            perform a focused assessment. Avoid assumptions; treat patient observations as clinically relevant.
          </p>

          <p><b>2) Involve appropriate supervision</b><br>
            If a concern arises that is outside routine sensitivity or requires clinical judgment, involve a supervising dentist promptly.
            Clear escalation pathways reduce conflict and improve outcomes.
          </p>

          <p><b>3) Maintain a non-defensive communication style</b><br>
            Defensive responses tend to escalate situations. Use calm, neutral language focused on understanding and evaluation, e.g.,
            “Let’s take a closer look,” or “Let’s review this together.”
          </p>

          <p><b>4) Avoid minimizing the patient’s experience</b><br>
            Reassurance is appropriate, but it should be paired with action: examination, documentation, and clear next steps. If the
            patient remains concerned, further evaluation is warranted.
          </p>

          <p><b>5) Document objectively and thoroughly</b><br>
            Documentation should include: (a) the patient’s concern in their own words, (b) clinical observations, (c) any supervisory
            consultation, and (d) recommended follow-up steps.
          </p>

          <p><b>6) Encourage follow-up (including independent evaluation when appropriate)</b><br>
            If uncertainty remains, recommending follow-up—including an independent evaluation—supports transparency and patient autonomy.
          </p>

          <p><b>7) Learn from unresolved encounters</b><br>
            If a patient leaves a practice due to unresolved concerns, conduct a process review: supervision norms, communication
            training, and incident escalation procedures.
          </p>
